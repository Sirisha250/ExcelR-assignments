Setting Up an AWS Account & Security Best Practices
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the most popular cloud platforms. To get started with AWS, you need to create an account and secure it properly. Security is crucial because AWS handles sensitive data, and an insecure account could lead to data breaches, financial loss, or unauthorized access.

Steps to Set Up an AWS Account
1️⃣ Sign Up for AWS
Go to AWS Website – Visit aws.amazon.com and click “Create an AWS Account”.
Enter Email & Password – Use a strong password for security.
Provide Contact Information – Choose between Personal or Business account.
Enter Billing Details – AWS requires a credit/debit card for verification (you won’t be charged for free-tier services).
Verify Identity – AWS will send a code via SMS or a phone call for verification.
Select Support Plan – Choose from Basic (Free), Developer, or Business support plans.
Sign In to AWS Management Console – Once set up, log in to access AWS services.
Key Security Best Practices After Creating an AWS Account
🔒 1. Secure the Root User Account
Avoid using the root user for daily tasks. Instead, create an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user with admin privileges.
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the root user to prevent unauthorized access.
🛡 2. Use IAM Roles & Policies for Permissions
IAM (Identity and Access Management) allows you to control who can access what in AWS.

Create IAM users instead of sharing the root account.
Use IAM roles to assign permissions instead of giving direct access.
Follow the Principle of Least Privilege – Grant only the permissions needed.
🔑 3. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a temporary code from an authenticator app.
Protects against password leaks or stolen credentials.
Use MFA for:
✅ Root user
✅ IAM users with sensitive access
✅ AWS services like IAM roles and API access
💰 4. Set Up Billing Alerts & Budgets
AWS charges based on usage, so monitor spending to avoid unexpected costs.
How to enable AWS Billing Alerts:
Go to AWS Billing Dashboard.
Enable Billing Alerts in the preferences.
Set up CloudWatch billing alarms to get notified when costs exceed a limit.
🏰 5. Secure Access with AWS Security Tools
AWS CloudTrail – Tracks API calls and logs user activity for auditing.
AWS Config – Monitors AWS resource changes and security policies.
AWS Shield – Protects against DDoS attacks.
Why Security is Important When Creating an AWS Account?
Prevents Unauthorized Access – A weak account could be hacked, leading to stolen data.
Avoids Unexpected Costs – Hackers can misuse resources, leading to high AWS bills.
Ensures Compliance & Data Protection – Many industries require strict security (GDPR, HIPAA).
Protects Business Reputation – A security breach can lead to customer trust issues.
